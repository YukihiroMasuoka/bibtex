abstract = "In this paper we define and study a propositional μ-calculus Lμ, which consists essentially of propositional modal logic with a least fixpoint operator. Lμ is syntactically simpler yet strictly more expressive than Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL). For a restricted version we give an exponential-time decision procedure, small model property, and complete deductive system, theory subsuming the corresponding results for PDL."

abstract = "Propositional μ-calculus is an extension of the propositional modal logic with the least fixpoint operator. In the paper introducing the logic Kozen posed a question about completeness of the axiomatisation which is a small extension of the axiomatisation of the model system K. It is shown that this axiomatisation is complete."
