	abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents a proof theoretical analysis of the intuitionistic theory of generalized inductive definitions iterated an arbitrary finite number of times. Like the Hilbert type systems of first order predicate logic that are used, the theories of single and iterated generalized inductive definitions formulated do not lend themselves immediately to a proof theoretical analysis. Therefore, the chapter reformulates the axioms expressing the principles of definition and proof by generalized induction as rules of inference similar to those introduced by Gentzen in his system of natural deduction for first order predicate logic. As in Gentzen's case, this reformulation leads to a notable systematization that is already in the case of ordinary inductive definitions, the rules corresponding to the axioms that express the principle of definition by induction appearing as introduction rules for the inductively defined predicates, whereas the axioms that express the principle of proof by induction give rise to the corresponding elimination rules. Moreover, the generalized inductive definitions appear as inductive definitions iterated once and the iterated generalized inductive definitions as inductive definitions iterated twice or more.},
