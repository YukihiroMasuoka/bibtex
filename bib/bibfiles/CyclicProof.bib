  abstract={We present two finitary cut-free sequent calculi for the modal μ-calculus. One is a variant of Kozen's axiomatisation in which cut is replaced by a strengthening of the induction rule for greatest fixed point. The second calculus derives annotated sequents in the style of Stirling's `tableau proof system with names' (2014) and features a generalisation of the ν-regeneration rule that allows discharging open assumptions. Soundness and completeness for the two calculi is proved by establishing a sequence of embeddings between proof systems, starting at Stirling's tableau-proofs and ending at the original axiomatisation of the μ-calculus due to Kozen. As a corollary we obtain a new, constructive, proof of completeness for Kozen's axiomatisation which avoids the usual detour through automata and games.},

However, in contrast to their work, our proof system does not require an extension of logical syntax by ordinal variables.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that some variants of cyclic proof systems for symbolic heap entailments in separation logic do not enjoy the cut elimination property. To construct complete system, we have to consider the cut rule, which requires some heuristics to find cut formulas in bottom-up proof search. Hence, we hope to achieve some restricted variant of cut rule which does not change provability and does not interfere with automatic proof search without heuristics. This paper gives a limit on this challenge. We propose a restricted cut rule, called the presumable cut, in which cut formula is restricted to those which can occur below the cut. This paper shows that there is an entailment which is provable with full cuts in cyclic proof system for symbolic heaps, but not with only presumable cuts.},

It is easily shown that cyclic proof subsumes proof by (co)induction. So cyclic proof systems are at least as powerful as the corresponding proof systems with explicit (co)induction rules. Whether or not the converse inclusion holds is a non-trivial question. In this paper, we resolve this question in one interesting case. We show that a cyclic formulation of first-order arithmetic is equivalent in power to Peano Arithmetic. The proof involves formalising the meta-theory of cyclic proof in a subsystem of second-order arithmetic.},

The ﬁrst proof system adopts a traditional approach to inductive proof, extending the usual sequent calculus for predicate BI with explicit induction rules for the inductively deﬁned predicates. The second system allows an alternative mode of reasoning with inductive deﬁnitions by cyclic proof. In this system, the induction rules are replaced by simple case-split rules, and the proof structures are cyclic graphs formed by identifying some sequent occurrences in a derivation tree. Because such proof structures are not sound in general, we demand that cyclic proofs must additionally satisfy a global trace condition that ensures soundness. We illustrate our inductive deﬁnition framework and proof systems with simple examples which indicate that, in our setting, cyclic proof may enjoy certain advantages over the traditional induction approach.},
