	abstract = {Infinite trees naturally arise in the formalization and the study of the semantics of programming languages. This paper investigates some of their combinatorial and algebraic properties that are especially relevant to semantics. This paper is concerned in particular with regular and algebraic infinite trees, not with regular or algebraic sets of infinite trees. For this reason most of the properties stated in this work become trivial when restricted either to finite trees or to infinite words. It presents a synthesis of various aspects of infinite trees, investigated by different authors in different contexts and hopes to be a unifying step towards a theory of infinite trees that could take place near the theory of formal languages and the combinatorics of thefree monoid.},
