abstract = "In this paper we define and study a propositional μ-calculus Lμ, which consists essentially of propositional modal logic with a least fixpoint operator. Lμ is syntactically simpler yet strictly more expressive than Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL). For a restricted version we give an exponential-time decision procedure, small model property, and complete deductive system, theory subsuming the corresponding results for PDL."

In the paper introducing the logic Kozen posed a question about completeness of the axiomatisation which is a small extension of the axiomatisation of the model system K. It is shown that this axiomatisation is complete."

	abstract = {We present a sequent calculus for formally verifying modal μ-calculus properties of concurrent processes. Building on work by Dam and Gurov, the proof system contains rules for the explicit manipulation of fixed-point approximants. We develop a new syntax for approximants, incorporating, in particular, modalities for approximant modification. We make essential use of this feature to prove our main result: the sequent calculus is complete for establishing arbitrary μ-calculus properties of context-free processes.},
