  abstract={We present two finitary cut-free sequent calculi for the modal μ-calculus. One is a variant of Kozen's axiomatisation in which cut is replaced by a strengthening of the induction rule for greatest fixed point. The second calculus derives annotated sequents in the style of Stirling's `tableau proof system with names' (2014) and features a generalisation of the ν-regeneration rule that allows discharging open assumptions. Soundness and completeness for the two calculi is proved by establishing a sequence of embeddings between proof systems, starting at Stirling's tableau-proofs and ending at the original axiomatisation of the μ-calculus due to Kozen. As a corollary we obtain a new, constructive, proof of completeness for Kozen's axiomatisation which avoids the usual detour through automata and games.},

	abstract = {We consider a cyclic approach to inductive reasoning in the setting of first-order logic with inductive definitions. We present a proof system for this language in which proofs are represented as finite, locally sound derivation trees with a “repeat function” identifying cyclic proof sections. Soundness is guaranteed by a well-foundedness condition formulated globally in terms of traces over the proof tree, following an idea due to Sprenger and Dam. However, in contrast to their work, our proof system does not require an extension of logical syntax by ordinal variables.},

	isbn = {978-3-030-59025-3},
	abstract = {It has been shown that some variants of cyclic proof systems for symbolic heap entailments in separation logic do not enjoy the cut elimination property. To construct complete system, we have to consider the cut rule, which requires some heuristics to find cut formulas in bottom-up proof search. Hence, we hope to achieve some restricted variant of cut rule which does not change provability and does not interfere with automatic proof search without heuristics. This paper gives a limit on this challenge. We propose a restricted cut rule, called the presumable cut, in which cut formula is restricted to those which can occur below the cut. This paper shows that there is an entailment which is provable with full cuts in cyclic proof system for symbolic heaps, but not with only presumable cuts.},
